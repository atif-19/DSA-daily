🧠 Question: Implement Selection Sort in C++

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts:
- The sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right.
- The sublist of items remaining to be sorted.

At every iteration, the minimum element from the unsorted part is picked and moved to the sorted part.

🔁 Time Complexity:
Best, Average, and Worst Case: O(n^2)
🧊 Not stable, and not adaptive.

📌 Example:
Input:  [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

class Solution {
  public:
    void selectionSort(vector<int> &arr) {
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; i++) {
            int index = i;
            for(int j = i + 1; j < arr.size(); j++) {
                if(arr[j] < arr[index])
                    index = j;
            }
            swap(arr[i], arr[index]);
        }
    }
};
