    /*
        Function: countNonLeafNodes
        ---------------------------
        Counts all non-leaf nodes in a binary tree.

        A non-leaf node is defined as any node that has 
        **at least one child** (left or right).

        Approach:
        ---------
        - If the root is NULL → return 0 (empty tree has no non-leaf nodes)
        - If the node has **no left and no right child** → return 0
            (it's a leaf node, not counted)
        - Otherwise:
            - count this node (add 1)
            - recursively count in left subtree
            - recursively count in right subtree

        Parameters:
        -----------
        - root : pointer to the root node of the binary tree

        Returns:
        --------
        - Integer count of non-leaf nodes
    */
    int countNonLeafNodes(Node* root) {

        // Base case: empty tree OR a leaf node → not a non-leaf
        if ((root == NULL) || (!root->left && !root->right))
            return 0;

        // Count this node + recursive counts from left and right subtree
        return 1 + countNonLeafNodes(root->left) + countNonLeafNodes(root->right);
    }
};
